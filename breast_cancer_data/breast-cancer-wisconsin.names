3. Past Usage:

   Attributes 2 through 10 have been used to represent instances.
   Each instance has one of 2 possible classes: benign or malignant.

      -- Size of data set: only 369 instances (at that point in time)
      -- Collected classification results: 1 trial only
      -- Two pairs of parallel hyperplanes were found to be consistent with
         50% of the data
         -- Accuracy on remaining 50% of dataset: 93.5%
      -- Three pairs of parallel hyperplanes were found to be consistent with
         67% of data
         -- Accuracy on remaining 33% of dataset: 95.9%

      -- Size of data set: only 369 instances (at that point in time)
      -- Applied 4 instance-based learning algorithms 
      -- Collected classification results averaged over 10 trials
      -- Best accuracy result: 
         -- 1-nearest neighbor: 93.7%
         -- trained on 200 instances, tested on the other 169
      -- Also of interest:
         -- Using only typical instances: 92.2% (storing only 23.1 instances)
         -- trained on 200 instances, tested on the other 169

4. Relevant Information:

   Samples arrive periodically as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases.
   The database therefore reflects this chronological grouping of the data.
   This grouping information appears immediately below, having been removed
   from the data itself:

     Group 1: 367 instances (January 1989)
     Group 2:  70 instances (October 1989)
     Group 3:  31 instances (February 1990)
     Group 4:  17 instances (April 1990)
     Group 5:  48 instances (August 1990)
     Group 6:  49 instances (Updated January 1991)
     Group 7:  31 instances (June 1991)
     Group 8:  86 instances (November 1991)
